# Walmart_Sales_Analysis

Project Overview:-

  This project involves analyzing Walmart sales data for the months of January, February, and March. The goal is to provide insights and actionable recommendations to increase sales in April by identifying key      sales trends across cities, branches, product categories, and customer demographics. Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn were used for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

Problem Statement:-

The objective is to analyze sales data from January to March to identify trends, uncover underperforming areas, and recommend strategies for increasing sales in April.

Task:-

1.Gathered the Walmart Sales dataset, ensuring it contains relevant columns for analysis.

2.Clean and preprocess the sales data to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and eliminate outliers to ensure accurate analysis.

3.Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and trends in the sales data for the three-month period.

4.Correlation Analysis: Analyzed the correlation matrix to identify relationships between variables.

5.Visualize sales performance using charts and graphs to effectively communicate findings.

6.Provide actionable recommendations based on data insights to improve sales in April.

Insights:-

1.City and Branch-Based Performance:

• Mandalay: Branches A and B performed best, while Branch C struggled.

• Naypyitaw: Branches A and C outperformed, with Branch B underperforming.

• Yangon: Branches B and C led in sales, while Branch A underperformed.

2.Product-Based Insights:

• Mandalay: Top-performing products include Electronic Accessories, Fashion Accessories, Health and Beauty, and Sports and Travel. Low-performing products include Food and Beverages, and Home and Lifestyle.

• Naypyitaw: Strong sales in Electronic Accessories, Fashion Accessories, and Food and Beverages, while Health and Beauty, Home and Lifestyle, and Sports and Travel lagged.

• Yangon: High sales for Electronic Accessories, Food and Beverages, Home and Lifestyle, and Sports and Travel. Lower sales for Fashion Accessories and Health and Beauty.

3.Gender-Based Insights:

• Female Customers: Prefer Electronic Accessories, Fashion Accessories, Food and Beverages, Home and Lifestyle, and Sports and Travel, but show less interest in Health and Beauty.

• Male Customers: Prefer Electronic Accessories, Food and Beverages, and Health and Beauty, with lower interest in Fashion Accessories, Home and Lifestyle, and Sports and Travel.

4.Time-Based Insights:

• Peak sales hours are at 13:00, 15:00, and 19:00.

• Moderate sales are seen at 10:00, 11:00, 12:00, and 18:00.

• Low sales occur at 14:00, 16:00, 17:00, and 20:00.

5.correlation Analysis:

Revenue is primarily driven by quantity sold (0.71) and unit price (0.63), indicating that increasing sales volume and pricing can significantly boost revenue. Ratings (-0.036) and hours (-0.0027) have negligible impact on revenue.


Recommendations:-

1.Promotional Campaigns:

• Launch city- and branch-specific promotions to boost sales in underperforming branches and product lines.
• Focus on peak hours for maximum impact.

2.Customer Retention:

• Implement loyalty programs in high-performing branches (Mandalay A and B, Naypyitaw A and C, Yangon B and C) to retain valuable customers.

3.Seasonal Sales:

• Leverage April holidays or events for themed sales that encourage purchases of both top- and low-performing products.

4.Gender-Specific Promotions:

• For female customers, promote Health and Beauty products through targeted campaigns.

• For male customers, bundle Electronic Accessories with Food and Beverages to encourage more purchases.

5.Time-Based Strategies:

• Run flash sales during peak hours and implement "happy hour" promotions during low sales periods to drive traffic.

6.Focus on Increasing Quantity Sold:

• Since Quantity has the strongest positive impact on Revenue, driving more sales volume through marketing, promotions, or bundling could lead to significant revenue growth.

7.Collect Feedback:

• Use surveys or feedback forms to understand customer preferences and address any concerns about underperforming products. Adjust marketing strategies based on this input.

Used Technology:-

• Python

• Pandas

• NumPy

• Matplotlib 

• Seaborn

• Jupyter Notebook

Conclusion:-

The analysis provides a detailed understanding of sales patterns across cities, branches, product categories, and customer demographics. By implementing targeted strategies based on the observed trends, Walmart can increase its sales performance in April, optimizing both marketing efforts and customer retention.
